# FoodieliciousXpress

This is a website that I have coded along with Jonas Schmedtmann while learning from his udemy course
"Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3".I did the project in 2018.

There are some elements that I have added while learning the above technologies.
  1. I have made a custom logo which is designed by me in the photoshop.It's not ugly as looks in the website.
  2. Some templete information is also different and modified
